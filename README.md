+The JavaScript Applications course (JS Apps) develops practical skills for building front-end applications with JavaScript, jQuery, ReactJS, AJAX and REST services. The course is based on state-of-the-art standards and JS technologies (ES2017 is used).
+
+Studying HTTP, REST and jQuery AJAX and accessing REST services with AJAX queries. JavaScript and REST-based client applications are built to retrieve and visualize data from public REST APIs such as GitHub API, TheMovieDb API, and CRUD through REST authentication service. Consideration is also being given to building backend REST services on cloud-based storage platforms (backend-as-a-service / BaaS).
+
+The principles of asynchronous JavaScript programming with promises, async / await and Web workers, as well as Web storage (cookies, session and local storage) and the use of auxiliary libraries, tools and technologies such as Babel transpiler, Grunt and Gulp, ESLint , lodash, sammy, and others.
+
+For creating UI and templating data ReactJS technology is used, which provides a state-of-the-art model for building responsive, reusable JavaScript UI components by combining HTML and JavaScript.
+
+The technologies studied in the course combine to build a single-page application based on MVC architecture (model-view-controller) with ReactJS for the UI part, Sammy.js (for routing and events) and jQuery AJAX to call REST services from an existing REST API).
+
+The course is highly focused on practice, with a huge number of class exercises, a practical team project and a practical exam. The participants in the course develop a practical team project (SPA application with MVC, REST and ReactJS). For a knowledge test, the course ends with a practical exam on building a front-end SPA application with JS, jQuery AJAX, REST services and ReactJS. In case of good performance during the course and the final exam, a certificate for the acquired practical skills is issued.
+
+The course is part of the complete program with JavaScript courses and tutorials for the <a href="https://softuni.bg/professions/javascript">JavaScript developer</a> training at the University of Software.
